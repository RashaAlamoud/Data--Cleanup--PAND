# Data-Cleanup-PAND  using Alteryx 
Project Data Cleanup Predictive Analytics Nanodegree Program

# Project Overview
This project is the first part of a two-part series. In the first part, you will blend and format data and deal with outliers.

For the second part, you will use your cleaned up dataset to create another linear regression model. The difference this time is that you will have to choose which variable(s) are the most important for the model using new techniques learned in the Selecting Predictor Variables section.

# Scenario
Pawdacity is a leading pet store chain in Wyoming with 13 stores throughout the state. This year, Pawdacity would like to expand and open a 14th store. Your manager has asked you to perform an analysis to recommend the city for Pawdacityâ€™s newest store, based on predicted yearly sales.
